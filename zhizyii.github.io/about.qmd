This website serves as a documentation of my journey in **NM2207: Computational Media Literacy**, taken in AY23/24 Semester 1. On this webpage, I am excited to share my journey of learning the R programming language with you!

# Weekly Progress

In the documentations page, I compiled all the Challenges and Code-alongs that I completed in NM2207 from weeks 1 to 9. The documents will be organized by week, where each week consists of a **Code-along**, where I followed coding practices from lecture videos, and a **Challenge**, where I completed coding questions. Feel free to explore my work!

# Conclusion

Thank you for visiting and following along with my journey. If you have any questions or feedback, do not hesitate to contact me!
